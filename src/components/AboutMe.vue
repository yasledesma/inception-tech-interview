          Glad to see you're looking at this page. I figured since the project came with an "about" page, I would not let it go blank and use it to say some stuff about me here.
          <br>
          <strong>My name is Yasmin, and I'm a software developer from Argentina.</strong> I currently do fullstack web development, but I specialize in backend stuff, mostly. So, sorry if this project ends up being more function over form; so to speak. I do a better job using Figma files.
          <br>
          Also, I do have a few cats of my own, but posting pictures of them this early into an interview process is not my thing, to be honest. So here are a few random gif I have in my images folder!
